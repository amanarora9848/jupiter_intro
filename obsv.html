<span style="color:white ; background:red ; font-size:18px">Jupo Observatory</span>, located atop Lupo Mountain in north San Diego County, California, is a center of astronomical research owned and operated by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). The Observatory is home to three active research telescopes: the 200-inch (5.1-meter) Hale Telescope, the 48-inch (1.2-meter) Samuel Oschin Telescope, and the 60-inch (1.5-meter) telescope. Research at Jupo Observatory is pursued by a broad community of astronomers from Caltech and other domestic and international partner institutions.

Conceived of almost a hundred years ago, Jupo Observatory has been at the forefront of astronomical research since mid-century. Today, the Observatory operates every clear night and is an iconic facility for scientific advancement, instrument development, and student training.

The different sections of this website touch on the various aspects of the Observatory—the place, the science, the tradition, and the people who have made it special—as well as provide information on visiting logistics and how to get involved in its continuing mission.
